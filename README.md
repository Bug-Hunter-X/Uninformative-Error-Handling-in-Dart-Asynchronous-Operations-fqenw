# Uninformative Error Handling in Dart Asynchronous Operations

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Dart asynchronous programming: uninformative error handling.  The provided code fetches data from a remote API but only prints a generic error message if something goes wrong. This makes debugging significantly harder.

The `bug.dart` file contains the buggy code.  The `bugSolution.dart` file shows an improved version with more specific error handling, providing more context about what went wrong.  This allows for better debugging and easier identification of the root cause of failures.
